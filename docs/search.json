    "text": "GenAI has definitely helped me out a lot. From University, to my workplace at SIT x NVIDIA AI Center. I have used it to generate code, debug, and even brainstorm ideas. I have also used it to help me with my Quarto website for this portfolio.\n\n\n\nI chose ChatGPT because of its versatility, ease of use, and its ability to generate coherent and structured responses almost instantly. It was readily accessible through a web interface, and I could ask it questions, test ideas, and request help in clarifying technical concepts.\n\n\n\n\nThroughout my assessment, ChatGPT helped me in various ways:\n\nClarifying technical concepts – For example, I was confused about how grid layouts work in Quarto. ChatGPT explained the .grid cols=2 syntax and helped me debug my .qmd structure.\nImproving Markdown formatting – It helped me clean up and restructure my pages so that the website layout was visually clearer and more responsive.\nSuggesting content – When I didn’t know how to start writing my personal introduction or project descriptions, ChatGPT provided sample content that I could modify and personalize.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEfficiency: I could quickly brainstorm ideas or troubleshoot issues without waiting for external help.\n24/7 Availability: I could work late at night or during weekends and still have reliable assistance.\nStructured Support: Instead of generic search results, ChatGPT gave me context-aware answers that often directly solved my problem.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccuracy concerns: Sometimes the information sounded correct but wasn’t entirely accurate — especially for very specific technical issues.\nOver-reliance: I found myself tempted to ask ChatGPT before trying things out myself, which can affect independent problem-solving.\nFormatting limitations: In some cases, the response formatting would break in RStudio Visual mode, so I had to manually fix it.\n\n\n\n\n\nI believe GenAI tools like ChatGPT will play a significant role in both my academic and professional future:\n\nIn university, I can use it to refine code, debug Markdown, summarize research papers, and brainstorm ideas for projects.\nIn industry, I see GenAI as a productivity enhancer — useful for writing documentation, reviewing code, or generating boilerplate for new systems.\n\n\n\n\n\nOverall, using GenAI for this assessment made me realize how valuable this technology can be — not as a replacement for learning, but as a learning companion. When used responsibly, it enhances creativity, accelerates development, and empowers users to achieve more.\n\n“Generative AI doesn’t replace thinking — it extends it.”"
